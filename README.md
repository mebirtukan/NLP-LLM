# NLP-Email-Spam-Detection and #Huggingface_Langchain:Summerizing a document

NLP-Email-Spam-Detection:This project demonstrates a comprehensive approach to email spam detection, leveraging NLP techniques and machine learning to achieve accurate classification.

Huggingface_Langchain:Summerizing a document: The objective of this project is to create an automated summarization tool for a PDF document. 
Specifically, we aim to summarize a research paper titled "Review and Evaluation of Eye Movement Event Detection Algorithms" published on MDPI. Summarizing complex research papers effectively can be challenging due to their length and technical content. 
The goal is to leverage Natural Language Processing (NLP) technologies to extract meaningful summaries from such documents efficiently.
